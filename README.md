## Important information:
- To work on the project you will need to install all of the dependencies. This project is currently using Python version 3.11 (the newest version). All of the additional libraries are in the requirements.txt file. To install those files run the command *pip install -r requirements.txt*.
- A Python virtual environment is recommended if you are working on other projects in Python.
- The main backend file is init.py in the home directory.
- The *templates/* directory should contain all of the .html files and the *static/* directory should contain all .css files.

#### Database stuff:
- The database file is the SQLite file database.db, you don't need to have SQLite installed to run the project, but you do need it installed if you want to run SQL commands on the file. If you want to install SQLite, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XA3w8tQnYCA) video really helped me.
- the models.py file contains all of the SQLAlchemy code needed to create the necessary tables (called *models*).
